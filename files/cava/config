# Cava Audio Visualizer Configuration Template
# Optimized for smooth and responsive visualization

[general]
# Number of bars (20-200) - fewer bars = better performance
bars = 64
# Framerate (1-144) - higher = smoother but more CPU intensive
framerate = 60

[input]
# Audio input method: pulse, alsa, fifo, or portaudio
method = pulse
# Audio device (leave as default for auto-detection)
source = auto

[output]
# Output method: ncurses, terminal, raw, or circle
method = ncurses
# Terminal color scheme
style = stereo

[color]
# Color gradient for bars using template variables
gradient = 1
gradient_count = 8

gradient_color_2 = '#65d590'
gradient_color_3 = '#7fc5df'

gradient_color_7 = '#c6a2fe'
gradient_color_8 = '#ff8f98'

[smoothing]
# Noise reduction (0-100) - higher = smoother but less responsive
# 77 is default, 85 provides good balance for smooth visualization
noise_reduction = 85

# Monstercat smoothing (0 or 1) - adds smoothing between adjacent bars
monstercat = 1

# Wave effect (0 or 1) - creates wave-like motion across bars
waves = 0

# Gravity (0-200) - controls how fast bars fall
# 100 = normal gravity, 150 = faster fall, 50 = slower fall
gravity = 120

[eq]
# Equalizer settings for frequency response
# Lower frequencies tend to be louder, so reduce them slightly
